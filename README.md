# IT_PI: Dimensionless learning based on information 
_The code implements IT-PI, a model-free method that combines dimensional analysis with the principles of
information theory, which identifies dimensionless variables with the highest
predictive power by measuring their shared information content. ._
## Features 
- applies to algebraic, ODE, and PDE relationships
- identifies optimal dimensionless inputs
- distinguishes physical regimes
- discovers self-similar variables
- extracts characteristic scales
- provides a bound of the minimum predictive error achievable across all possible models
- ranks variables by predictability
- evaluates model efficiency
## Getting started
Use the following command to install all required libraries:
```sh
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib pandas cma
```
See the Jupyter notebooks for examples in the paper.
